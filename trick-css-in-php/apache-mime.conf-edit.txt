	# AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers":
	# actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
	# or added with the Action directive (see below)

	# To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories:
	# (You will also need to add "ExecCGI" to the "Options" directive.)
